Version 0.26
------------

This release is intended to be the last one before 1.0.  Therefore a major
cleanup was done.  This **breaks backward compatibility**.  If your code is
really outdated, please read this list carefully and grep your code.

- Removed decorator `@alias` (deprecated since v.0.19).

- Removed decorator `@plain_signature` (deprecated since v.0.20).

- Dropped support for old-style functions that implicitly expected namespace
  objects (deprecated since v.0.21).  The `@expects_obj` decorator is now
  mandatory for such functions.

- Removed decorator `@command` (deprecated since v.0.21).

- The `@wrap_errors` decorator now strictly requires that the error classes
  are given as a list (old behaviour was deprecated since v.0.22).

- The `allow_warnings` argument is removed from
  `argh.completion.autocomplete()`.  Debug-level logging is used instead.
  (The warnings were deprecated since v.0.25).

Some more stuff has been scheduled **to be purged before 1.0**:

- Deprecated arguments `title`, `help` and `description` in `add_commands()`
  helper function.  See documentation and #60.

Other changes:

- Improved representation of default values in the help.

- Dispatcher can be configured to skip unknown arguments (see #57).

- Added `add_subcommands()` helper function (a convenience wrapper
  for `add_commands()`).

- `EntryPoint` now stores kwargs for the parser.

Version 0.25
------------

- Added EntryPoint class as another way to assemble functions (see #59).

- Added support for Python 3.4; dropped support for Python 3.3
  (this doesn't mean that Argh is necessarily broken under 3.3, 
  it's just that I'm not testing against it anymore).

- Shell completion warnings are now deprecated in favour of `logging`.

- The command help now displays default values of all arguments (see #64).

- Function docstrings are now displayed verbatim in the help (see #64).

- Argh's dispatching now should work properly in Cython.
