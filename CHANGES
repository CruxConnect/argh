Version 0.25
------------

- Added EntryPoint class as another way to assemble functions (see #59).

- Added support for Python 3.4; dropped support for Python 3.3
  (this doesn't mean that Argh is necessarily broken under 3.3, 
  it's just that I'm not testing against it anymore).

- Shell completion warnings are now deprecated in favour of `logging`.

- The command help now displays default values of all arguments (see #64).

- Function docstrings are now displayed verbatim in the help (see #64).

- Argh's dispatching now should work properly in Cython.
