       :Python 2.x:
           `sys.stdout` is a file-like object that accepts `str` (bytes)
           and breaks when `unicode` is passed to `sys.stdout.write()`.
       :Python 3.x:
           `sys.stdout` is a `_io.TextIOWrapper` instance that accepts `str`
           (unicode) and breaks on `bytes`.

       In Python 2.x arbitrary types are coerced to `unicode` and then to `str`.

       In Python 3.x all types are coerced to `str` with the exception
       for `bytes` which is **not allowed** to avoid confusion.
