Agrh, argparse!
===============

Did you ever say "argh" trying to remember the details of `optparse` or
`argparse` API?  If yes, this package may be useful for you.

`Argh` provides a wrapper for `argparse`.  `Argparse` is a very powerful tool;
`argh` just makes it easy to use.

In a nutshell
-------------

Here's a list of features that `argh` adds to `argparse`:

* mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before the parser
  is instantiated;
* nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of
  course used under the hood);
* infer command name from function name;
* infer agrument type from the default value;
* infer argument action from the default value (for booleans);
* infer arguments from function signature;
* add an alias root command ``help`` for the ``--help`` argument;
* enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of a
  `argparse.Namespace` object.

`Argh` is fully compatible with `argparse`.  You can mix `argh`-agnostic and
`argh`-aware code.  Just keep in mind that the dispatcher does some extra work
that a custom dispatcher may not do.

Installation
------------

    $ pip install argh

Example
-------

A very simple application with one command::

    from argh import *

    @dispatch_command
    @arg('name')
    def main(args):
        return 'Hello ' + args.name

An application with multiple commands::

    @command
    def echo(text='hello'):
        print text

    @command
    def another_echo(text='hi there'):
        print text

    parser = ArghParser()
    parser.add_commands([echo, another_echo])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parser.dispatch()

The powerful API of `argparse` is also available::

    @arg('text', default='hello world', nargs='+', help='The message')
    def echo(args):
        print args.text

The approaches can be safely combined.
