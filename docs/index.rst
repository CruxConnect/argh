Agrh, argparse!
===============

Did you ever say "argh" trying to remember the details of `optparse` or
`argparse` API? If yes, this package may be useful for you.

`Argh` provides a wrapper for `argparse`. `Argparse` is a very powerful tool;
`argh` just makes it easy to use.

In a nutshell
-------------

Here's a list of features that `argh` adds to `argparse`:

* mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before the parser
  is instantiated;
* nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of
  course used under the hood);
* infer command name from function name;
* infer agrument type from the default value;
* infer argument action from the default value (for booleans);
* infer arguments from function signature;
* add an alias root command ``help`` for the ``--help`` argument;
* enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of a
  :class:`argparse.Namespace` object.

`Argh` is fully compatible with `argparse`. You can mix `argh`-agnostic and
`argh`-aware code. Just keep in mind that :func:`~argh.dispatching.dispatch`
does some extra work that a custom dispatcher may not do.

Dependencies
------------

The `argh` library is supported (and tested unless otherwise specified) on
the following versions of Python:

* 2.6 (`argparse` library is required)
* 2.7 (including PyPy 1.8)
* 3.1 (`argparse` library is required; **not** tested)
* 3.2
* 3.3

Stability
---------

`Argh` is well-tested (could be better but still 80-100% test coverage).

The API may change in the future but there are no such plans yet.
