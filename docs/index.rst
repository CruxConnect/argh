Agrh, argparse!
===============

Did you ever say "argh" trying to remember the details of `optparse` or
`argparse` API? If yes, this package may be useful for you.

`Argh` provides a very simple wrapper for `argparse`. `Argparse` is a very
powerful tool; `argh` just makes it easy to use.

In a nutshell
-------------

Here's a list of features that `argh` adds to `argparse`:

* mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before the parser
  is instantiated;
* nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of
  course used under the hood);
* infer command name from function name;
* infer agrument type from the default value;
* infer argument action from the default value (for booleans);
* infer arguments from function signature;
* add an alias root command ``help`` for the ``--help`` argument;
* enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of a
  :class:`argparse.Namespace` object.

`Argh` is fully compatible with `argparse`. You can mix `argh`-agnostic and
`argh`-aware code. Just keep in mind that :func:`~argh.dispatching.dispatch`
does some extra work that a custom dispatcher may not do.

Dependencies
------------

The `argh` library is supported (and tested unless otherwise specified) on
the following versions of Python:

* 2.6 (`argparse` library is required)
* 2.7 (including PyPy 1.8)
* 3.1 (`argparse` library is required; **not** tested)
* 3.2
* 3.3

.. versionchanged:: 0.15
   Added support for Python 3.x, dropped support for Python â‰¤ 2.5.

.. versionchanged:: 0.18
   Improved support for Python 3.2, added support for Python 3.3.

Stability
---------

`Argh` is well-tested (could be better but still 80-100% test coverage).

The API may change in the future but there are no such plans yet.

Similar projects
----------------

* argdeclare_ requires additional classes and lacks support for nested
  commands.
* argparse-cli_ requires additional classes.
* django-boss_ seems to lack support for nested commands and is strictly
  Django-specific.
* entrypoint_ is lightweight but involves a lot of magic and seems to lack
  support for nested commands.
* opster_ and finaloption_ support nested commands but are based on the
  outdated `optparse` library and therefore reimplement some features available
  in `argparse`. They also introduce decorators that don't just decorate
  functions but change their behaviour, which is bad practice.
* simpleopt_ has an odd API and is rather a simple replacement for standard
  libraries than an extension.
* opterator_ is based on the outdated `optparse` and does not support nested
  commands.
* clap_ ships with its own parser and therefore is incompatible with
  `clap`-agnostic code.
* plac_ is a very powerful alternative to `argparse`. I'm not sure if it's
  worth migrating but it is surely very flexible and easy to use.
